# portfolio2018

Last year I created a visual novel game with Phaser.js for my portfolio project.
It had some (massive :D) problems with responsivity and generally was a spaghetti code.

This year I decided to write something simmilar, but better, without using any gaming libraries.
My experiences from last year allowed me to gather feedback and I'm trying to add all suggestions to newest version of my game.

I took a chance and added links to my other projects so you can also go there and check it out. Please do!

Current state of my project:

    3/4 tabs of main site are complete (may require fixing)
    game tab requires one or two weeks of work

 To do:
 - Add choices
 - Add endings
 - Find good backgrounds
 - RWD for game content
 - Story!
