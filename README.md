# portfolio2018

Last year I created a visual novel game with Phaser.js for my portfolio project.
It had some (massive :D) problems with responsivity and generally was a spaghetti code.

This year I decided to write something similar, but better, without using any gaming libraries.
My experiences from last year allowed me to gather feedback and I'm trying to add all suggestions to newest version of my game.

I took a chance and added links to my other projects so you can also go there and check it out. Please do!

Current state of my project: * Up and running! Yahoo! *

 To do:
- Write more tests
- Consider new features (save/load based on localStorage, backlog scrolling)
